## About me ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology. I am currently in the process of writing my Engineering Thesis on Reinforcement Learning. I am working on projects in Python, SQL, and R. 

ðŸ“š My favorite projects:

*   [Analysis of weather data using the ARMA model](https://github.com/Oliwia-Makuch/arma-projekt) - Real Data Analysis using the ARMA Model. The analysis will be carried out on a set of weather data obtained from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management in the years 2001â€“2023 for the Pszczyna station.
*   [Life expectancy and teenage birth rate](https://github.com/Oliwia-Makuch/raport-correlation-who) - Life expectancy and teenage birth rate in selected countries based on the WHO Annual Report 2022.
*   ["Trening przed maturÄ… rozszerzonÄ… z matematyki"](https://www.empik.com/trening-przed-matura-rozszerzona-z-matematyki-oliwia-makuch-wrobel-mateusz,p1456511883,ksiazka-p) - "Training Before the Extended Matura Exam in Mathematics", comprehensive preparation guide for students taking the extended-level Matura exam in mathematics, offering exercises, explanations, and strategies.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

* Application of reinforcement learning methods to optimize navigation in a transportation simulation environment.
* Mathematical modeling of decision-making processes in insurance and finance.
* Risk management project for a global food, snack and beverage company.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

* R (survey data analysis)
* Databases (SQL, MariaDB)
* Machine learning (OpenAI Gym, Sarsa, Q-Learning)
